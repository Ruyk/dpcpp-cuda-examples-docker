DPCPP CUDA Examples Docker Image
=================================

This docker image uses a pre-built DPCPP CUDA compiler to set up an environment that can be used to run the SYCL for CUDA examples in https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/SYCL-For-CUDA-Examples/.

The docker image is based on nvidia/cuda:latest, and requires nvidia-docker to run the CUDA applications.
